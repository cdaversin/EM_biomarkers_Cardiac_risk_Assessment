by Lucia Priego, Maria Teresa Mora, Jordi Llopis-Lorente, Henrik Finsberg, CÃ©cile Daversin-Catty, Ilsbeth Van Herck, Samuel Wall, Hermenegild Arevalo, Francisco Javier Saiz, and Beatriz Trenor.

This repository contains the source code and data used in the manuscript "Integration of Electrophysiological and Mechanical Biomarkers in Cardiac Risk Assessment Models". The code is organized in the following directories:

- [`matlab_scripts`](matlab_scripts): MATLAB scripts to run 0D simulations.
- [`simcardems`](simcardems): FEniCS-based cardiac electro-mechanics solver.
- [`simcardems_scripts`](simcardems_scripts): Python scripts to run cardiac electro-mechanical to run 3D simulations using `simcardems`.
